This document will have the most up to date list of plugins known to work within a multi-column region. 

### Admonition
---
- **Reading Mode**
    - Works as expected.
- **Live Preview**
    - Renders but buttons are un-interactable.

### Custom Frames
---
- **Reading Mode**
    - Works as expected.
- **Live Preview**
    - Renders but on every file interaction the view is re-rendered.
